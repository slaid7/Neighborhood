          is an American animated television series created by Jeff Trammell for
          the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the
          character Spider-Man. It is the 12th television series in the Marvel
          Cinematic Universe (MCU) from Marvel Studios and is produced by Marvel
          Studios Animation. The series explores Peter Parker's origin story and
          early days as Spider-Man, and is set in an alternate timeline from the
          main films and television series of the MCU where Norman Osborn
          becomes Peter's mentor instead of Tony Stark. Trammell serves as
          showrunner and head writer, with Mel Zwyer as supervising director.

          Hudson Thames voices Peter Parker / Spider-Man, reprising his role
          from the Marvel Studios animated series What If...? (2021–2024), with
          Kari Wahlgren, Grace Song, Eugene Byrd, Zeno Robinson, Colman Domingo,
          Hugh Dancy, and Charlie Cox also starring. Disney+ announced the
          series as Spider-Man: Freshman Year in November 2021, with Trammell
          attached. It was originally intended to be set in the main MCU
          continuity but the creative team found this too restrictive and
          decided to move it to an alternate timeline, allowing the series to
          explore familiar ideas and characters in new ways. It was retitled
          Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man by December 2023. The 3D
          cel-shaded animation pays homage to the art style of early The Amazing
          Spider-Man comic books by Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr., with
          animation provided by Polygon Pictures and CGCG, Inc.

          explores Peter Parker's origin story and early days using the
          Spider-Man persona. The series is set in an alternate timeline within
          the multiverse,[1][2] where Peter gains his abilities through a
          temporal paradox caused by Dr. Stephen Strange time-traveling while he
          is fighting a symbiotic alien.[3] Another change in this universe is
          that Norman Osborn becomes Peter's mentor instead of Tony Stark, as
          happens in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's (MCU) main timeline.
